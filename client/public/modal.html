    <!-- The fact that positioned has a z-index of 0 and its child 'modal' has 10 creates a stacking context, that is, all the
        z-index of its children is 'nullified' or overwritten by its parent's. In case two adjacent elements had the same
        z-index, the one on top would be the one located the lowest in the tree. This is why we use Portals in React, 
        to render a child of a component that might be very deep in the tree as a child of another element or component, for
        example, the body element. -->
